File 1 computes first order approximations of the trading boundaries for small transaction cost parameter,
eq. (3.8), and also for non-zero risk-premia (the two are the same).

File 2 computes second order proxies, eq. (3.8), and for non-zero risk premia.

File 3 computes asymptotics of Performance figures in Theorem 3.1, equations (3.9) to (3.13).
