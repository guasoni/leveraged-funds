*The file Figures_1_to_5.sce is a SCILAB script that
allows to compute the optimal trading boundaries along with
some performance statistics. It produces all plots but the last one
in the paper Leveraged Funds: "Robust Replication
and Performance evaluation". (Figures 1 to 5)

Different Figures use a different range of gamma (aversion to tracking error), and different choices
of multipliers. For Figures 1,2 and 4, 5 we provide the files with trading boundaries; these can be 
reproduced by uncommenting some lines in the script.

For Figure 3, the script computes trading boundaries and R2 for gamma=0.5 and 1 directly.

* The file Figure_6.sce produces the final Figure 6.
